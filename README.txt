Classifier tool is an alternate solution to WEKA toolkit which I believe does not include many key features. 

Feature List in Classifier Tool:

1. No need to know coding if you have data in cvs format you can use tool to run various classification algorithms.
   Will add some more data formats. 
2. Various AI Algorithms like Naive Bayes, Single Layer Perceptron, Multi Layer Perceptron are implemented. 
3. Graphs to display results so that results can be visualized and easily understood 
4. Some Image classification algorithms are also implemented.
