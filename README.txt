Classifier tool is an alternate solution to WEKA toolkit which I believe does not include many key features. 

Feature List in Classifier Tool:

1. No need to know coding. If you have data as in cvs format. Will add some ore file types. 
2. Various AI Algorithms like Naive Bayes, Single Layer Perceptron, Multi Layer Perceptron...and many more will be included soon. 
3. Graphs to display results so that results can be visualized and can be easy to understand
